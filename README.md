# VGGNet Implementation
---
This repository contains an implementation of the VGGNet architecture introduced in the paper "Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition" by Karen Simonyan and Andrew Zisserman. The model was originally designed for the ImageNet Challenge 2014 and is renowned for its simplicity and depth, achieving state-of-the-art results in image classification tasks.
